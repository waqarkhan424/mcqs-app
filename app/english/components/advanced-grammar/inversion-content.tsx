            <Typography variant="h3">What is Inversion?</Typography>
            <p><strong>Inversion</strong> means changing the normal word order in a sentence. Usually, in English, the subject comes before the verb. In inversion, the verb comes before the subject in some special cases.</p>

            <Typography variant="h4">Why Use Inversion?</Typography>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>To sound more formal or literary</li>
                <li>To emphasize something</li>
                <li>To form questions</li>
            </ul>

            <Typography variant="h4">1. Inversion in Questions</Typography>
            <p>In questions, we naturally use inversion.</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Normal: You are coming.</li>
                <li>Question (Inversion): Are you coming?</li>
                <li>Normal: He has finished.</li>
                <li>Question: Has he finished?</li>
            </ul>

            <Typography variant="h4">2. Inversion After Negative Expressions</Typography>
            <p>When the sentence starts with a negative or limiting word, we invert the subject and verb.</p>
            <p><strong>Common negative expressions:</strong> never, rarely, seldom, hardly, not only, under no circumstances, at no time, little, etc.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Never have I seen such a beautiful sunset.</li>
                <li>Rarely does he speak in public.</li>
                <li>Not only did she pass the exam, but she also got the highest marks.</li>
                <li>At no time were they in danger.</li>
            </ul>

            <Typography variant="h4">3. Inversion After "So" and "Such"</Typography>
            <p>We use inversion after "so" and "such" for emphasis, especially with "that" clauses.</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>So tired was he that he fell asleep instantly.</li>
                <li>Such was her beauty that everyone stared at her.</li>
            </ul>

            <Typography variant="h4">4. Inversion After "Only" Expressions</Typography>
            <p>We use inversion after certain expressions starting with "only." Examples: only after, only when, only if, only then, only by, etc.</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Only after the meeting did I understand the problem.</li>
                <li>Only when he spoke did they listen.</li>
                <li>Only by working hard will you succeed.</li>
            </ul>

            <Typography variant="h4">5. Inversion After "Not Until"</Typography>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Not until I called her did she know the truth.</li>
                <li>Not until the rain stopped could we go outside.</li>
            </ul>

            <Typography variant="h4">6. Inversion with Conditionals (Without "if")</Typography>
            <p>Sometimes, we can remove "if" in conditional sentences and use inversion instead.</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Normal: If I had known, I would have helped.</li>
                <li>Inversion: Had I known, I would have helped.</li>
                <li>Normal: If you should need help, call me.</li>
                <li>Inversion: Should you need help, call me.</li>
            </ul>

            <Typography variant="h4">How to Spot Inversion</Typography>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Look for special words like never, rarely, only, not until, etc.</li>
                <li>Check if the verb comes before the subject.</li>
                <li>Ask: Is this a question or a formal statement?</li>
            </ul>


            <Typography variant="h4">Final Thoughts</Typography>
            <p>Inversion helps you speak and write more formally and clearly. You donâ€™t need to use it all the time, but knowing how it works will improve your English. Keep practicing with real examples!</p>
